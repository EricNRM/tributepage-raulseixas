    mystic Aleister Crowley, which influenced their collaboration. The influence extended not only to music, but also to plans for the creation of the 
    "Alternative Society".</h1>

    prospective members of the group. Seixas and Coelho are reported to have been tortured during their imprisonment.</h1>
